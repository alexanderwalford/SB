'Hi all,

I've been having some serious issues when publishing the attached project. When I attempt to publish the project, it complies and produces the correct files and also installs using the setup file. However, when I have finished installing the application, it doesn't run. I believe I'm missing some DLL files (and / or CefSharp dependencies) but I have absolutely no idea how to resolve my issue.

If you could look at the attached project files and provide feedback on what I need to do, that would be a massive help.

I'm aiming for the application to run on any x64 bit processor system running Windows 10.

Thank you!'
